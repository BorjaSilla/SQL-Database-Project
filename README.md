# SQL-Database-Project
The goal of this project is to build my own database from several CSV files. For this project, I will start with 6 CSV files. I will use data wrangling skills to clean it up, have a first look at the data to figure out out to structure it, prepare it to be loaded in an SQL database, and finally build it. Some graphs to better understand the data will surely be useful!!
